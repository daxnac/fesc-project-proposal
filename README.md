# Assignment 7: Google Charts

Add two charts to redesign project, using provided data below. One chart shows annual renewable energy production in Florida, and the other shows annual total electricity consumption in Florida. These charts can be added to an existing page in your site where they would make sense, or you can add a new page (/data maybe?) to hold the charts. If you add an additional page, it of course should share basic design with the rest of the site, e.g. header, nav, footer.

Select the chart type you feel best suits data. Use at least 3 configuration options to customize charts' appearances.

Add a note to the project's README file linking to the charting library used, and explaining why you chose the chart types you did. 

## Chart 1: Line Chart

Due to just the two simple column data tables, array length and high numbers (Btu's), Line chart seemed logical to give it a better visual and level of detail.

## Chart 2: Column Chart

Source: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/columnchart

Similar to the Electricity data on the line chart, very simple data, but wanted to try the column chart on this one to see how it will handle the array length. Then try different options to adjust the chart and bar sizes.
